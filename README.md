# Optimal Client Selection Algorithms for Federated Learning

Set of scheduling algorithms that optimize the selection of clients in the training phase of Federated Learning systems with heterogeneous resources.

### Implemented Algorithms

- *Minimal Makespan and Energy Consumption FL Schedule* (**MEC**): finds an optimal schedule that minimizes the makespan and the total energy consumption, in that order.


- *Minimal Energy Consumption and Makespan FL Schedule under Time Constraint* (**ECMTC**): finds an optimal schedule that minimizes the total energy consumption and the makespan, in that order, while meeting a deadline.
